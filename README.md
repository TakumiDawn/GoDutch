UIUC CS 411 Database System Project -- GoDutch

This application was my final project of CS411 course in UIUC. The goal of this project, GoDutch, is to help people better manage their grocery bill and also split the charge with their friends reasonably. It can recognize and store the information from a receipt upon user scanning using OCR. For frequent users, our app could also automatically predict the products that the user frequently purchases from historical data (previous receipts).
